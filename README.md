# Codexiuo

Codexiuo is a small part of my personal experiences that I‚Äôve been stuck with for a while. I‚Äôve always been looking for a tool to help me take notes for my ‚Äúknowledge book.‚Äù I tried various software and apps, but none of them fully met my needs. Then I thought, why not GitHub? That way, I can keep everything online and even share it with others.

## Overview

Here in Codexiuo, I‚Äôm collecting all the tips and tricks I‚Äôve learned and searched for: from clean code, language quirks, hidden features, to anything I think might be useful.
