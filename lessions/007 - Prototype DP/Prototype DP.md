## 🥷 Intro: Clone or Create?

Imagine you’ve got a robot, and it takes three days to build it. Now, what if you need another one? Would you spend another three days? Or would you just copy the first one?

Prototype Pattern says: “Dude, just clone it and save yourself the headache.”

---

## 🧬 So, what _is_ the Prototype Pattern?

Prototype is a **Creational Design Pattern**. Instead of creating new objects using `new`, you make a copy of an existing one. This clone can be an exact replica or slightly customized.

---

## 🧪 A Cool Example with TypeScript

```ts
interface Shape {
  clone(): Shape;
}

class Circle implements Shape {
  radius: number;

  constructor(radius: number) {
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  clone(): Shape {
    return new Circle(this.radius);
  }
}

const original = new Circle(42);
const ninjaClone = original.clone();

console.log(ninjaClone.radius); // 42
```

Just like a ninja, the clone sneaks in looking just like the original — but it's separate, so you can tweak it however you want.

---

## ⚔️ Why Clone?

- Creating a new object is expensive (time or resources)
- You want multiple similar versions
- You're tired of setting up everything from scratch with `new`

---

## 🧱 The Prototype Pattern Structure

```
📦 Prototype (interface)
 ┣━ clone(): Prototype

📦 ConcretePrototype
 ┣━ clone(): ConcretePrototype

📦 Client
 ┣━ Uses clone() to copy objects
```

---

## 🌟 Advantages

- Faster than building from scratch
- Reduces complexity
- Less dependency on specific classes

## 🐛 Challenges

- Deep vs Shallow copy issues
- Some objects are tricky to clone properly

---

## 📦 Codexiuo-style Conclusion

Next time you're building something, pause and ask:

> “Can I just clone it? Or am I about to waste three days of my life?”

The Prototype Pattern is the silent ninja of object-oriented programming — fast, quiet, and always ready.
