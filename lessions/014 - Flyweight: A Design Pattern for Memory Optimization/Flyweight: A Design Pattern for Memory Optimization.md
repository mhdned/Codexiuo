# Flyweight: A Design Pattern for Memory Optimization

The **Flyweight** pattern is a structural design pattern used to reduce the number of similar objects. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to create many objects that share common data. By using Flyweight, we can save memory by sharing common data among objects.

## Key Features of Flyweight:

**Data Sharing:** Constant and shared data among objects are shared across them.

**Improved Performance:** For large projects with many similar objects, Flyweight helps in reducing memory usage and improving performance.

**Reduced Complexity:** Instead of creating multiple objects with similar data, only one object is created for shared data.

## Components of Flyweight:

1. **Flyweight (Shared Tool):** Data that is shared across similar objects.
2. **ConcreteFlyweight (Specific Tool):** Data that is specific to individual objects.
3. **FlyweightFactory (Factory):** Responsible for creating and managing Flyweight objects.

## TypeScript Example:

Hereâ€™s a simple implementation of the Flyweight pattern in TypeScript:

```typescript
// Flyweight (Tool)
class Character {
  private sharedData: string;

  constructor(sharedData: string) {
    this.sharedData = sharedData;
  }

  public getSharedData() {
    return this.sharedData;
  }
}

// ConcreteFlyweight (Specific Tool)
class SpecificCharacter {
  private uniqueData: string;

  constructor(uniqueData: string) {
    this.uniqueData = uniqueData;
  }

  public getUniqueData() {
    return this.uniqueData;
  }
}

// FlyweightFactory (Factory)
class CharacterFactory {
  private characters: { [key: string]: Character } = {};

  public getCharacter(sharedData: string): Character {
    if (!this.characters[sharedData]) {
      this.characters[sharedData] = new Character(sharedData);
    }
    return this.characters[sharedData];
  }
}

// Client Code
const factory = new CharacterFactory();
const sharedData1 = factory.getCharacter("Red Character");
const sharedData2 = factory.getCharacter("Blue Character");

console.log(sharedData1.getSharedData()); // Red Character
console.log(sharedData2.getSharedData()); // Blue Character
```

### Explanation:

- In this implementation, `Character` stores the shared data that is used by all similar objects.
- `SpecificCharacter` stores the data that is unique to each object.
- `CharacterFactory` uses a shared object to store and manage these objects, ensuring that shared data is only created once.

## Advantages of Flyweight:

- **Memory Savings:** By sharing data, it prevents the excessive consumption of memory.
- **Improved Performance:** Faster execution and reduced processing time for large projects.

## Disadvantages:

- **Implementation Complexity:** Using this pattern requires careful management of data and objects.
- **Reduced Flexibility:** If the shared data needs to change, it can introduce more complexity.

Thus, Flyweight can help optimize memory usage and improve system efficiency for large projects with many similar objects.
